# BG-Changer
Background Changer for i3 (might work with other stuff too)

# Usage
On BGchangers initial launch, it will make a folder in your accounts home folder called Wallpapers close the program and move your background images into the folder.

on its sencond launch it will detect the images and start scrolling through, one per minute (by default, this can be changed)

# Options
(Only 2 so far)

**--time, -t :** this will let you change the ammount of time an image is displayed for.
*E.G. -t=5 or -t:5 = 5 mins/image.*

**--help, -h:** displays help page. (A little lacking rn)

# Requirements
Only Feh, Nim too if you want to compile it yourself.

Have fun <('-'<)
